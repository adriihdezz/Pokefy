# ðŸ¥— Pokefy - Poke Bowl Store

Welcome to **Pokefy**! This is a fictional web project for a poke bowl store, created as a practice to learn web development as well as GitHub repository management. I built this project as a side project, trying to start my journey into front-end development. I'm excited to continue learning and plan to share more projects as I refine my skills in the future :)

## ðŸ“Œ Description

This project consists of a static website showcasing different varieties of poke bowls with attractive images and a user-friendly interface. It was built using basic web development technologies:

- **HTML** for structure
- **CSS** for design and styling

I focused on crafting a responsive layout that works well on both desktop and mobile devices. The design process involved experimenting with various styles and layouts until I found one that truly represents the freshness and creativity behind a modern poke bowl store.
